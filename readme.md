# Withered Worlds

Planned:
- Enemies
- World-gen (structures only, no biomes)
- Nushu (no magic, just lore)

## Please

remodel staff to be breeze?

upgrade goat horn to dagger?

dagger change to a rare weapon dropped by an enemy
- increase damage & durability

finishing works without sweeping edge for some reason

retaliation uses damage_immunity component

mother of all curses (helmet) cusses when getting hit

obsidian dagger (high damage, dimension tear - turns piglins into zombies, or scare them)

bone needle

armadillo scute -> caestus (does it need parrying?)

wisteria trees

chorus fruit -> end clef/staff/point/ chorus stave / the conductor \ counterpoint/fleuret (french for foil)
has three enchantments:
- increase damage while in the air
- increase damage according to velocity
- increase damage after getting hit

(joke) giant spider on fire mob

raindeers that are modelled after sheep and summon rain when dead, and summon invisible bees when alive to aid crops

promises
- prosperity: brush a block to detect ores nearby
- intimacy: drain dur to heal allies and self, replenish by trading XP
- return: prismarine, grows crops faster in a chunk but deteriorates when leaving the sim radius
- perpetuity: resists poison, harming and wither
