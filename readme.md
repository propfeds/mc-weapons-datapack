# Weathered Worlds

Planned:
- Enemies
- World-gen (structures only, no biomes)
- Nushu (no magic, just lore)

## Please

try making a fake spear

tutorialise anvil repair recipes

foil currently takes 2 durability when attacking

mother of all curses (helmet) cusses when getting hit

obsidian dagger (high damage, dimension tear - turns piglins into zombies, or scare them)

bone needle

armadillo scute -> caestus (does it need parrying?)

foil enchantments:

(joke) giant spider on fire mob

dragonfly

raindeers that are modelled after sheep and summon rain when dead, and summon invisible bees when alive to aid crops

wisteria trees

refuges:
- like a village, but also with a school
- redstone acts like chalk, written on the ground
- Nushu lessons take place outdoors
- Chairs = logs? stairs?
- Teachers wear and sell redstone hats
- Poem books as chest loot

promises
- prosperity/plenty/providence: channel to advance crop/grass growth nearby, but offers blood sacrifice in the form of cattle (it will damage you if there's no cattle)
- intimacy: drain dur to heal allies and self, replenish by trading XP
- return: prismarine, grows crops faster in a chunk but deteriorates when leaving the sim radius
- perpetuity: resists poison, harming and wither

enderite: (joke) used to craft the enderong (ender gong)
