# To-do List

rework deflecting

make teacher's pointer stick with foil model and spear right click

bug: deflecting doesn't detect crawling in trapdoor

make trowel blocking not delete resistance effects

try making fake whip (rope dart) (fishing rod)

try making a fake spear (hoe???)

mother of all curses (helmet) cusses when getting hit

obsidian dagger (high damage, dimension tear - turns piglins into zombies, or scare them)

bone needle

armadillo scute -> caestus (does it need parrying?)

foil enchantments:
- increase damage while in the air
- increase damage according to velocity
- increase damage after getting hit

(joke) giant spider on fire mob

dragonfly

raindeers that are modelled after sheep and summon rain when dead, and summon invisible bees when alive to aid crops

wisteria trees

refuges:
- like a village, but also with a school
- redstone acts like chalk, written on the ground
- Nushu lessons take place outdoors
- Chairs = logs? stairs?
- Teachers wear and sell redstone hats
- Poem books as chest loot

hermit homes:
- in cliffside
- drawers with letters
- goat horns & trowels

promises
- prosperity/plenty/providence: channel to advance crop/grass growth nearby, but offers blood sacrifice in the form of cattle (it will damage you if there's no cattle)
- intimacy: drain dur to heal allies and self, replenish by trading XP
- return: prismarine, grows crops faster in a chunk but deteriorates when leaving the sim radius
- perpetuity: resists poison, harming and wither

enderite: (joke) used to craft the enderong (ender gong)
