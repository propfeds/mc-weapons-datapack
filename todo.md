try making fake whip (rope dart) (fishing rod)

try making a fake spear (hoe???)

mother of all curses (helmet) cusses when getting hit

promises
- prosperity/plenty/providence: channel to get bone meal, but offers blood sacrifice from nearby cattle (don't damage babies)
  - maybe just gives fortune 1
  - recipe: piglins are the only mobs that hunt cattle though? or maybe entirely new civ
  - damage type: instant damage
- intimacy: drain dur to heal allies and self, replenish by trading XP
- return: prismarine, grows crops faster in a chunk but deteriorates when leaving the sim radius
- perpetuity: resists poison, harming and wither

enderite: (joke) used to craft the enderong (ender gong)
