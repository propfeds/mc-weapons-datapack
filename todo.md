# To-do List

rename anvil_repair folder to anvil_restoration
rename scoreboard to anvil_restoration (no more kit)

foil: check out Han dynasty fencing swords

rework deflecting

axe enchantment that restores saturation on kill (battle hunger)

bug: deflecting doesn't detect crawling in trapdoor

try making fake whip (rope dart) (fishing rod)

try making a fake spear (hoe???)

mother of all curses (helmet) cusses when getting hit

obsidian dagger (high damage, dimension tear - turns piglins into zombies, or scare them)

bone needle

meteor hammer mobs to farm chain

giant spider on fire or spider centipede

dragonfly

wisteria trees

refuges:
- like a village, but also with a school
- redstone acts like chalk, written on the ground
- Nushu lessons take place outdoors
- Chairs = logs? stairs?
- Teachers wear and sell redstone hats
- Poem books as chest loot

hermit homes:
- in cliffside
- drawers with letters
- goat horns & trowels
- book hidden inside fish barrels or well

promises
- prosperity/plenty/providence: channel to get bone meal, but offers blood sacrifice from nearby cattle (don't damage babies)
  - recipe: piglins are the only mobs that hunt cattle though? or maybe entirely new civ
  - damage type: instant damage
- intimacy: drain dur to heal allies and self, replenish by trading XP
- return: prismarine, grows crops faster in a chunk but deteriorates when leaving the sim radius
- perpetuity: resists poison, harming and wither

enderite: (joke) used to craft the enderong (ender gong)
