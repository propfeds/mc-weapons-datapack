# To-do List

remove snow from taglib and move it to new tag raycast_passes_through that contains things like chains and lanterns

foil: check out Han dynasty fencing swords

change staff model when sitting down

rework deflecting

axe enchantment that allows scaling trees and leaves (pickaxe that allows scaling stone)
- either summon shulker at feet or reduce gravity

axe enchantment that restores saturation on kill (battle hunger)

normal staff upgrades to golden staff?

bug: deflecting doesn't detect crawling in trapdoor

make trowel blocking not delete resistance effects

try making fake whip (rope dart) (fishing rod)

try making a fake spear (hoe???)

mother of all curses (helmet) cusses when getting hit

obsidian dagger (high damage, dimension tear - turns piglins into zombies, or scare them)

bone needle

armadillo scute -> caestus (does it need parrying?)

meteor hammer mobs to farm chain

(joke) giant spider on fire mob

dragonfly

raindeers that are modelled after sheep and summon rain when dead, and summon invisible bees when alive to aid crops

wisteria trees

refuges:
- like a village, but also with a school
- redstone acts like chalk, written on the ground
- Nushu lessons take place outdoors
- Chairs = logs? stairs?
- Teachers wear and sell redstone hats
- Poem books as chest loot

hermit homes:
- in cliffside
- drawers with letters
- goat horns & trowels
- book hidden inside fish barrels or well

promises
- prosperity/plenty/providence: channel to advance crop/grass growth nearby, but offers blood sacrifice in the form of cattle (it will damage you if there's no cattle)
- intimacy: drain dur to heal allies and self, replenish by trading XP
- return: prismarine, grows crops faster in a chunk but deteriorates when leaving the sim radius
- perpetuity: resists poison, harming and wither

enderite: (joke) used to craft the enderong (ender gong)
